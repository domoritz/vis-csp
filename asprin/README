ASPRIN: ASP for Preference Handling
===================================

Asprin is a general framework for qualitative and quantitative optimization in answer set programming.

To learn how to use asprin, please have a look at Section 10.2 of the Potassco User Guide:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/guide/2.0/

Here we describe the distribution and explain how to install the system.


FILES
=====

asprin:        asprin system
asprin.py:     asprin python script
asprin.lib:    asprin preference library
asprin.parser: asprin parser (only with binary distribution)
clingo:        clingo-4.5.0  (only with mac binary distribution)
README:        this file

FOLDERS
=======

library:        preference programs that are part of asprin.lib
library/simple: preference programs that define basic preferences
examples:       some examples
src:            asprin sources (only with sources distribution)


UNIX and WINDOWS INSTALLATION from binaries
===========================================


Requirements:
- Python 2.7
- clingo-4.5.0 with Python support 

Sources of clingo-4.5.0 are available at:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/clingo/4.5.0/clingo-4.5.0-source.tar.gz

They have to be compiled with Python support 
(see section "Enabling Scripting Support" of the INSTALL file of the clingo distribution).
Note that the binaries included in the clingo distribution do not include this Python support,
which is needed for asprin.

To run asprin, the binary of clingo-4.5.0, named clingo, has to be in the PATH or in the current directory.


MAC INSTALLATION from binaries
==============================

Everything should be in place (at least in a mac 10.9.3).



COMPILATION FROM SOURCES
========================

Requirements:
- Python 2.7
- clingo-4.5.0 with Python support 
- asprin.parser

Sources of clingo-4.5.0 are available at:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/clingo/4.5.0/clingo-4.5.0-source.tar.gz

They have to be compiled with Python support 
(see section "Enabling Scripting Support" of the INSTALL file of the clingo distribution).
Note that the binaries included in the clingo distribution do not include this Python support,
which is needed for asprin.

To run asprin, the binary of clingo-4.5.0, named clingo, has to be in the PATH or in the current directory.
The binary of the asprin parser, named asprin.parser, also has to be in the PATH or in the current directory.
To compile the parser, see the INSTALL file of the directory src.
